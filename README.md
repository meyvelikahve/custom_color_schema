# custom_schema

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

After Flutter 2.10 update you can use ColorScheme.
use [ColorScheme.fromSeed] to generate a full set of colors.
This is so easy and so cool!

In this project i used these packages.

- provider
- flutter_colorpicker
